NAME
    daifuku - transaction logging in JSON, within the MySQL database

SYNOPSIS
      # print stored procedures / triggers for the tables
      daifuku dbname tblname1 tblname2 ...

      # install the procedures and triggers
      daifuku dbname tblname1 tblname2 ... | mysql -u root dbname

DESCRIPTION
    Daifuku generates stored procedures / triggers for logging the changes
    made through the transactions.

    The log is collected in the daifuku_log table in JSON format, so that it
    would be easy to use the log for whatever purpose (e.g. for audit, undo,
    display, etc.).

COMMAND OPTIONS
  --host=host
  --port=port
  --socket=socket-file
    override the default server location specified in "my.cnf"

  --help
    prints help

  --version
    prints the version number

STORED PROCEDURES
  daifuku_begin(info)
    The function instructs the triggers to log the current transaction. Upon
    return, the id of the row within the daifuku_log table in which the
    transaction will be logged is stored in the @daifuku_id user variable.

    The function cannot be used outside of a transaction.
